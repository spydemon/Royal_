How to contribute to the help content ?
===========================

As you can see, the help content is not exhaustive. In fact, writing a help system is a fully job, and we are already busy with Royal development. 

That is why, we propose you to contribute to the help content of Royal.

Why contribute ?
----------------

Of course, contribution is not compulsory, but here is a motivation reason list:

* By contributing, your name will appear in the contributor list.
* You are happy the free use of Royal. Contribution is the best way to pay the authors.
* It is not a big investment because writing help content file is easy thanks to the project named *EsTexte* (http://estexte.sourceforge.net).

How to contribute ?
------------------

There are two ways to contribute:

* If you found a spelling mistake. Go to the page http://trac.royal-project.org and post a bug in the *Documentation* category.
* You know what a version control system is. Checkout the *RoyalHelp* module in order to edit help files.


Writing a help file
-------------------

1. Editing a help file
......................

After you get the *RoyalHelp* module :

* Edit help file with text editor (open txt fomrat file only). 

    All the files are located in *RoyalHelp/src/wiki*. The directory *fr* contains french files, et and directory *en* contains english one.

* Use the *EsTexte* syntax to write page content. Do not hesitate to look into existing pages or http://estexte.sourceforge.net/guide.html first.


* Save modifications.
     

2. Display the result
.....................

    You must install *ANT* (http://ant.apache.org/) in order to display the result.
    
* Open a DOS command window (or a terminal).

* Go to the *RoyalHelp* directory.


* Type these commandes:
    * _ant thirdparty_ (first time only). 
    * _ant -Dlocale=&lt;lang&gt; [-Dpage=&lt;page&gt;] dev run-demo_, whose &lt;lang&gt; value is _fr_ or _en_ (french ou english) and &lt;page&gt; value is a page name without html extension.
* When the result is acceptable, copy/paste file content in the *Help Contribution* of Bidry's forum.

    A thread by help file and its traduction, and do not forget to sign up your post (for the contributor list ;) ). The modifications will be available in the next release of Royal.


3. Some simple rules
....................

If you want that the Royal help system stay useful, you must follow 5 rules :

* Avoid the number of spelling mistakes.
* Bannish grammatical mistakes.
* Help content does not SMS language.
* Respect the common structure of documents (title, subtitle, etc..).
* The author reserve the right to modify the text, the screenshots, etc..


If you read these lines, it means that you want really to help us. Thank you.
